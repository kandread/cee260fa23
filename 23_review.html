<p>
The number of surface flaws in plastic panels in the interior of automobiles has a Poisson distribution with a mean of 0.05 flaw per ft<sup>2</sup> of panel. Assume that an automobile interior contains 10 ft<sup>2</sup> of plastic panel.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability that there are no surface flaws in an auto's interior?

<p>
The thickness of a conductive coating in \({\mu}m\) has a density function of \(600x^{-2}\) for \(100\;{\mu}m< x < 120\;{\mu}m\).
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Determine the mean and variance of the coating thickness.

<p>
A large parabolic antenna is designed against wind load. During a wind storm, the maximum wind-induced pressure on the antenna, \(P\), is computed as \[P=\dfrac{1}{2}CRV^2\] where \(C\) is the drag coefficient, \(R\) is the air mass density, \(V\) is the maximum wind speed. These 3 variables are statistically independent lognormal variables with means of 1.80, 2.3 \(\times\) 10<sup>-3</sup> slugs/ft<sup>3</sup>, 120 ft/sec and coefficient of variations 0.20, 0.10, 0.45 respectively.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability distribution of the maximum wind pressure? What are its parameters?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability that the maximum wind pressure will exceed 30 lb/ft<sup>2</sup>?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
The actual wind resistance capacity of the antenna is also a lognormal variable with a mean of 90 lb/ft<sup>2</sup> and a coefficient of variation of 0.15. During a storm, what is the probability of failure of the antenna?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
If the occurrences of storm follow a Poisson process with a mean occurrence rate of once every 5 years, what is the probability of failure of the antenna in 25 years?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Suppose five antennas were built and installed in a given region. What is the probability that at least two of the five antennas will not fail in 25 years? Assume that failures between antennas are statistically independent.
