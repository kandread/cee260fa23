<li>Flaws occur at random along the length of a thin copper wire</li>
<li>\(X\) is the number of flaws in a length of \(L\) millimeters of wire</li>
<li>Suppose that the average number of flaws on a wire is \(\lambda\)</li>

Partition the length of the wire into \(n\) intervals of small length
\(\Delta L=L/n\)

<ul>
<li>If intervals small enough, probability that more than one flaws occurs in each is negligible</li>
<li>Flaws occur at random = same probability of flaw (\(p\))</li>
<li>Occurrence of flaw in interval independent of other intervals</li>

Approximate with binomial
\[E[X]=\lambda = n p \Rightarrow p = \dfrac{\lambda}{n}\]

In the last 50 years, there have been two major (\(M \geq 6\)) earthquakes in California. What is the probability of such a large earthquake in the next 15 years if we model them as Bernoulli or Poisson sequence?

<p>
A steel pipeline that transports crude oil over a distance of 100 km, is subject to damaging corrosion. From past annual inspection, the average distance between locations of such corrosion is 0.15/km. The occurrence of corrosion is modeled as a Poisson process. What is the probability that there will be 10 locations of corrosion between inspections?

<p>
What is the probability of at least 5 corrosion sites between inspections?

<h3 id="org29b4129">Problem 10.3</h3>
<p>
A structure with a design life of 50 yrs is planned for a site with high-intensity earthquakes with a return period of 100 yr. The structure is designed to have a 0.99 probability of not suffering damage within its design life. Damage effects between earthquakes are statistically independent.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
If the occurrence of high-intensity earthquakes is modeled by a Bernoulli sequence, what is the probability of damage to the structure under a single earthquake?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Using the damage probability for a single earthquake calculated, what is the probability of damage to the structure in the next 20 yrs, assuming that the occurrences of earthquakes follow a Poisson process?
